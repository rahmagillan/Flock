              <h6>What is Flock?</h6>
              <p>
                Flock is a real-world implementation of a video platform
                inspired by the Pomodoro technique that is used for more
                effective studying and work habits. Flock allows users to set a
                study break after a given amount of time to balance
                psychological and physical wellbeing with online work and
                studying.
              </p>

                <ul>

                    Simply enter your name, create a meeting code, and enter the
                    duration you would like for your break time and work time.

                    Enter your name, and enter in the given meeting code by the
                    host of the meeting, and you will join the call.

              <h6>Why is Flock important?</h6>
              <p>
                Due to COVID, screen time through calling for work and studying
                has increased dramatically, increasing an average of around 20%
                for all countries affected by the pandemic. Long sitting times
                in front of a screen can lead to eye strain, loss in
                productivity, and fatigue and carpal tunnel syndrome. After
                having to sit through hour-long meetings, we realized there was
                a need to have a better platform that encourages productivity
                alongside oneâ€™s personal wellbeing - and Flock was born.{" "}
              </p>
              <h6>Our vision for future flocks of users</h6>
              <p>
                We value the mental and physical wellbeing, and hope that
                whether our application be used for study groups to improve
                productivity, or be used in a corporate setting; breaks are
                being implemented to better the health of everyone.{" "}
